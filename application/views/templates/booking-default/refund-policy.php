                    <p>You are not eligible for a full refund of the purchase. We can only refund 50% of the net purchase amount if
                    you request a refund in 3 days after purchase has been made. After 3 days, any refund request will be ignored.

                    you will get all the purchase items either.</p>

                    <h4>Refund Process</h4>

                    will be deducted from your refund amount.</p>

                    <p>If until the due date you haven’t received a refund yet, first check your bank account. Then contact your
                    credit card company, it may take some time before your refund is officially posted. Next contact your bank.
                    There is often some processing time before a refund is posted. If you’ve done all of this and you still have
                    not received your refund yet, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@media-vista.com">info@media-vista.com</a><br/><br/>or mail to:<br/><br/>
